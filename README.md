## Known Issues

### Clipboard stops working in Gnome 3.20

On Gnome 3.20, the clipboard stops working after the lock screen appears.

See https://github.com/OttoAllmendinger/gnome-shell-screenshot/issues/4

As a workaround, restart the shell: `Ctrl-F2` `r` `Enter`. The clipboard
should work again afterwards.
